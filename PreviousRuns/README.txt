These are saved pickle files of previous simulations run. 
They are saved as Ij (which is the "power") and Delay (which is the mirror position). 

The simulation is saved in the name: Chamb means power was calculated as equation 8, Narrow means there is a solid angle given by the following number in degrees (10,20,30), 2.07mm is the frequency of the source, and -161.375 is the x location of the source launch point (all others are assumed to be launched from the focus). Vert means it was vertically launched. NOLIM means rays were chosen from a hemisphere and used if they reached the first ellipse.
