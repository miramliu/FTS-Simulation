This is a repository of a version of the ray trace simulation of a compact fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) written by Mira Liu over the years 2016-2019 while working with Dr. Stephan S. Meyer, Dr. Ritoban Basu Thakur, and Zhaodi Pan. All of this was written in python, and tested with jupyter notebooks. 

Included in this repository are three base .py files necessary to run the simulation. Also included is one sample .ipynb jupyter notebook file to demonstrate the use of different functions. Within each base .py file there are also descriptions of the functions. There is also a labeled diagram of the FTS called 'CAD_FTS_labeled' that demonstrates all physical aspects included in this simulation. Lastly there is a .pkl file that contains every step of the simulations of a 90Ghz light source with 500 rays. ToPickle.txt describes the formate of the pickle file. 

All code is written by Mira Liu.
